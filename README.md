# AB-Testing

A/B testing, also referred to as split testing or bucket testing, is a methodology that involves comparing two versions of a webpage or app to determine which one performs better. 

In this particular project, data from the popular mobile puzzle game, Cookie Cats, was utilized. The game features gates that players encounter as they progress, which require them to wait or make an in-app purchase before continuing. Upon installation, players were randomly assigned to either gate_30 (control group) or gate_40 (experimental group). The objective of this project is to conduct an A/B test and determine whether moving the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40 would yield any benefits.

Dataset used was from datacamp - cookie_cats.csv
